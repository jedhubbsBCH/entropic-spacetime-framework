v2.0 Abstract

We propose a phenomenological framework in which spacetime carries two scalar
fields of entropic character that modify gravitational dynamics across cosmic scales.
ST (temporal entropy) is postulated to increase monotonically throughout the uni-
verse, providing a dynamical mechanism for time’s arrow through an explicitly time-
asymmetric potential. SS (spatial entropy) serves as an order parameter for the
quantum-to-classical transition of spacetime itself: taking small values in regions
where quantum coherence persists and large values where decoherence has created
classical behavior.
Within the DHOST (Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor) formalism, we in-
troduce three phenomenological functions: h (SS ) modifies the gravitational coupling
in regions of quantum spacetime while recovering Einstein gravity in classical re-
gions; V (ST , SS ) contains a linear term α ST that breaks time-reversal symmetry;
and f (SS ) modulates matter-gravity coupling based on the local quantum state of
spacetime.
This framework offers a unified phenomenological description of several cosmo-
logical puzzles: dark matter effects emerge from regions where partial decoherence
creates intermediate SS values, dark energy arises from the time-asymmetric po-
tential V , and the Hubble tension could result from different ST values probed by
early versus late universe measurements. The framework requires several conjectures
about how quantum coherence patterns persist across cosmic scales—mechanisms
that would need justification from a future theory of quantum gravity.
We identify observable predictions including: (i) environmental dependence of
galaxy dynamics based on local SS values, (ii) correlations between regions of modi-
fied gravity and time flow anomalies, (iii) deviations in black hole photon ring radii,
and (iv) quantum interference experiments coupling to gravitational fields. While
the mathematical consistency of this two-field DHOST theory requires further anal-
ysis, the framework provides a concrete phenomenological target for testing whether
quantum properties of spacetime itself might explain cosmic structure.
