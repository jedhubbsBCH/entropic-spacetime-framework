Summary
The universe remains an enigma, governed by two powerful yet incompatible theories: Einstein's General Relativity, describing the grand cosmic ballet, and Quantum Mechanics, dictating the bizarre rules of the subatomic world. This fundamental disconnect, alongside persistent mysteries like dark matter and dark energy, signals a missing piece in our understanding. What if the very fabric of spacetime, and even the arrow of time itself, emerged from something more fundamental: entropy?
A new "entropic spacetime framework" proposes just that. It introduces two fundamental scalar fields: a temporal entropic field (ST) that inherently drives the unidirectional flow of time, and a spatial entropic field (SS) that forms an intrinsically vibrating medium, giving rise to the wave-particle duality of quantum entities. Crucially, these fields interact with matter and gravity through a "resonant coupling" mechanism, meaning their influence is not universal but becomes pronounced only under specific conditions.
This resonant interplay offers a fresh, intuitive lens through which to view the cosmos. It suggests a dynamic origin for dark energy, potentially resolving the cosmological constant problem, and provides an alternative explanation for galaxy rotation curves without needing conventional dark matter. Beyond cosmology, this framework speculatively extends its reach to the origins of chirality, the emergence of life, and even the nature of consciousness and quantum computing, hinting at a unified "resonance code" underlying reality. While still in its early stages, this ambitious approach invites us to reconsider the fundamental building blocks of our universe, offering a potentially simpler and more cohesive picture.
