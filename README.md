v2.0 Abstract

We propose a phenomenological framework in which spacetime carries two scalar
fields of entropic character that modify gravitational dynamics across cosmic scales.
ST (temporal entropy) is postulated to increase monotonically throughout the uni-
verse, providing a dynamical mechanism for time’s arrow through an explicitly time-
asymmetric potential. SS (spatial entropy) serves as an order parameter for the
quantum-to-classical transition of spacetime itself: taking small values in regions
where quantum coherence persists and large values where decoherence has created
classical behavior.
Within the DHOST (Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor) formalism, we in-
troduce three phenomenological functions: h (SS ) modifies the gravitational coupling
in regions of quantum spacetime while recovering Einstein gravity in classical re-
gions; V (ST , SS ) contains a linear term α ST that breaks time-reversal symmetry;
and f (SS ) modulates matter-gravity coupling based on the local quantum state of
spacetime.
This framework offers a unified phenomenological description of several cosmo-
logical puzzles: dark matter effects emerge from regions where partial decoherence
creates intermediate SS values, dark energy arises from the time-asymmetric po-
tential V , and the Hubble tension could result from different ST values probed by
early versus late universe measurements. The framework requires several conjectures
about how quantum coherence patterns persist across cosmic scales—mechanisms
that would need justification from a future theory of quantum gravity.
We identify observable predictions including: (i) environmental dependence of
galaxy dynamics based on local SS values, (ii) correlations between regions of modi-
fied gravity and time flow anomalies, (iii) deviations in black hole photon ring radii,
and (iv) quantum interference experiments coupling to gravitational fields. While
the mathematical consistency of this two-field DHOST theory requires further anal-
ysis, the framework provides a concrete phenomenological target for testing whether
quantum properties of spacetime itself might explain cosmic structure.

v2.1 Abstract
We propose a framework for the emergence of physical reality from a single
irreducible principle: the binary singularity, a primordial act of distinction giving
rise to a propagating duality. From this minimal substrate, we construct the
mathematical and physical structure of the universe, including Peano arithmetic,
real analysis, and differential geometry. The core of the framework is an entropic
resonance, Sresonance, a coupling between spatial and temporal entropy gradients hypothesized
to seed the differentiation of geometry and fields. We define two scalar
fields—SS(x) representing spatial organization and ST (x) representing directional
entropy flow—whose interaction gives rise to a generalized entropic action. We
argue that the variation of this action has the potential to reproduce key astrophysical
and cosmological phenomena without invoking dark matter or inflation.
As a proof-of-concept, our preliminary simulations show qualitative agreement with
the flat rotation curves of galaxies and the primary features of the anisotropic polarization
spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The framework is
presented as a potential route toward a parsimonious explanation for gravitation,
field dynamics, and the arrow of time as emergent consequences of information flow.
