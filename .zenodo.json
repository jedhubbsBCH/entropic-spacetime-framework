  "description": "This repository hosts the evolving manuscript for the Entropic Spacetime Framework, a meta-theoretical proposal aiming to unify fundamental physics with emergent complexity. It introduces novel temporal (S_T) and spatial (S_S) entropic fields and a resonant coupling mechanism (S_coupling) to address puzzles like quantum gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. The framework also explores speculative connections to consciousness, quantum computing, and the origins of life. This is a living document, continuously updated to reflect ongoing mathematical derivations, simulation results (e.g., galaxy rotation curves), and community feedback. We invite critical engagement and collaboration from theoretical physicists, cosmologists, neuroscientists, and AI researchers to refine and expand this ambitious interdisciplinary work.",
